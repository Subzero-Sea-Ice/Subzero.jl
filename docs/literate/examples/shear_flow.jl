# This simulation creates a periodic simulation with an ocean shear flow current. It is very
# similar to the example created in the tutorial. The tutorial explains the
# setup in greater detail. It is a good starter simulation for understanding how the code
# works and playing around with a basic setup.

# This simulation shows how to setup a basic `domain` where all four boundaries are `periodic`.
# It also creates non-constant, shear `ocean` field. The `ocean` `u`-velocities are zero at
# the minimum and maximum y-extents (constant across x-values). The `u` values increase from
# the top and bottom of the domain towards the center to 0.5m/s, again constant across x-values,
# varying with y-values.

# ## User Inputs
const FT = Float64  # Float type used to run simulation
const Lx = 1e5      # grid x-length
const Ly = 1e5      # grid y-length
const Δgrid = 2e3   # grid cell edge-size
const hmean = 0.25  # mean floe height
const Δh = 0.0      # difference in floe heights - here all floes are the same height
const Δt = 20       # timestep
const nΔt = 5000;   # number of timesteps to run

# ## Grid Creation
grid = RegRectilinearGrid(; x0 = 0.0, xf = Lx, y0 = 0.0, yf = Ly, Δx = Δgrid, Δy = Δgrid)

# ## Domain Creation

wboundary = PeriodicBoundary(West; grid)

# ## Ocean Creation

# ## Atmosphere Creation

# ## Floe Creation
floe_settings = FloeSettings(subfloe_point_generator = SubGridPointsGenerator(; grid, npoint_per_cell = 2))
floe_generator = VoronoiTesselationFieldGenerator(; nfloes = 50, concentrations = [0.75], hmean, Δh)
floe_arr = initialize_floe_field(FT; generator = floe_generator, domain, rng = Xoshiro(1), floe_settings)

# ## Model Creation
model = Model(; grid, ocean, atmos, domain, floes = floe_arr)

# ## Constants Creation
modulus = 1.5e3*(mean(sqrt.(floe_arr.area)) + minimum(sqrt.(floe_arr.area)))
consts = Constants(; E = modulus)

# ## Output Creation
dir = "shear_flow"
init_fn, floe_fn = "shear_flow_init_state.jld2", "shear_flow_floes.jld2"

# ## Simulation Creation
simulation = Simulation(; model, consts, writers, Δt, nΔt, floe_settings, verbose = true, rng = Xoshiro(1))

# ## Running the Simulation
@time run!(simulation)

# ## Plotting the Simulation

# !!! note
#       Note that this is just using the built-in basic plotting. However, it is easy to write
#       your own plotting code. See the source code for a basic outline.
