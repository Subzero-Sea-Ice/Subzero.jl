# # Tutorial

# This is the user tutorial for Subzero.jl. It will walk you through the typical workflow of 
# buidling a discrete-element model (DEM) with Subzero.jl as well as running and plotting your
# simulatuion.

# ## Core ideas behind Subzero.jl simulations


# The very first step of running a Subzero simulation is to bring the package into scope.

# ## Creating a Grid

# Each Subzero model requires a grid object. The grid object defines the grid for the ocean
# and atmosphere. Ocean and atmosphere vectors (like `u` and `v` velocities) and tracers
# (like temperature) are recorded on these grid points and grid lines. The grid points are
# then used for interpolation for coupling between the ice, ocean, and atmosphere.

# All Subzero grid objects are concrete types of the abstract type [`AbstractRectilinearGrid`](@ref).
# Right now, all grid objects must be Rectilinear. Currently the only implemented concrete type
# is a [`RegRectilinearGrid`](@ref). If you are interested in implementing another type of
# grid, see the [developer documentation]("devdocs.md").

# Here, we will go ahead and create an instance of `RegRectilinearGrid`. We need to specify
# the grid endpoints and either the number of grid cells in both directions, or the size of
# the grid cells. Here we will specity the number of grid cells in the x-direction, `Nx`, and
# in the y-direction, `Ny`.

grid = RegRectilinearGrid(; x0 = -1e5, xf = 1e5, y0 = 0.0, yf = 1e5, Nx = 20, Ny = 10)

# We plot a dashed box around the grid so that we can see the that the grid matches the extent given.
# We also place tick-marks at the desired grid cell lengths. Finally, set the plot's aspect ration to `2`
# as the x-extent is two-times larger than the y-extent.
fig = Figure();
ax1 = Axis(fig[1, 1];  # set up axis tick marks to match grid cells
    title = "Grid Setup",
    xticks = range(grid.x0, grid.xf, 5), xminorticks = IntervalsBetween(5),
    xminorticksvisible = true, xminorgridvisible = true, xticklabelrotation = pi/4,
    yticks = range(grid.y0, grid.yf, 3), yminorticks = IntervalsBetween(5),
    yminorticksvisible = true, yminorgridvisible = true,
)
lines!(  # plot boundary of grid with a dashed line
    [grid.x0, grid.x0, grid.xf, grid.xf, grid.x0],  # point x-values
    [grid.y0, grid.yf, grid.yf, grid.y0, grid.y0];  # point y-values
    linestyle = :dash, linewidth = 3.0)
# Resize grid to layout
colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 2))

# ## Creating Boundaries

# Next, each Subzero.jl model needs a `Domain`. A `Domain` defines the region of the grid that
# the ice floes are allowed in, what happens to them when they reach the boundaries of that
# region, and if there is any topography in the model, along with the ice, in that region.

# Similarly to the `grid` above, the `Domain` will be rectilinear, defined by four boundaries,
# one for each of the cardinal direction. You will be able to pass each of the cardinal
# directions ([`North`](@ref), [`South`](@ref), [`East`](@ref), and [`West`](@ref)), defined as
# types by Subzero, to the boundary constructors. Each boundary can have different behavior, allowing
# the user to create a wide variety of domain behavior. Right now, four types of `AbstractBoundaries`
# are implemented: [`OpenBoundary`](@ref), [`PeriodicBoundary`](@ref), [`CollisionBoundary`](@ref), and
# [`MovingBoundary`](@ref).

# In this example, we will use two `CollisionBoundary` walls and two `PeriodicBoundary` walls
# to create a channel that the ice can infinitly flow through, from the east back to the west.
# In the north and the south, the ice will collide with the boundaries, as if there was shoreline
# preventing it from leaving the channel.

# We will use the grid we made above to define the boundaries so that they exactly border the grid.

north_bound = CollisionBoundary(North; grid)
south_bound = CollisionBoundary(South; grid)
east_bound = PeriodicBoundary(East; grid)
west_bound = PeriodicBoundary(West; grid)

# If we plot the polygons that are created within each boundary object, we can see that they border
# the grid. These polygons are how we well when the ice floes are interacting with each of the
# boundaries. We can also see that the boundaries overlap in the corners to ensure there is
# a solid border around the grid. The `PeriodicBoundary` elements are in purple while the
# `CollisionBoundary` elements are in teal.

poly!(   # plot each of the boundaries with a 50% transparent color so we can see the overlap
    [north_bound.poly, south_bound.poly, east_bound.poly, west_bound.poly];
    color = [(:purple, 0.5), (:purple, 0.5), (:teal, 0.5), (:teal, 0.5)],
)
ax1.title = "Grid and Boundary Setup"
fig  # display the figure

# ## Creating Topography
# We then have the option to add in a [`TopographyField`](@ref Subzero.TopographyField), which is a collection of
# [`TopographyElement`](@ref)s. If we want to add in topography field, we can create one using
# the [`initialize_topography_field`](@ref) function. Here we will create two islands in the
# channel. For simplcity, both will be triangles. I create the polygons that define the shape
# of each island using [`GeoInterface`](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterface.jl) and
# defining the points with tuples:
island1 = GI.Polygon([[(-6e4, 7.5e4), (-4e4, 5e4), (-2.5e4, 7e4), (-6e4, 7.5e4)]])
island2 = GI.Polygon([[(5e4, 2.5e4), (5e4, 5.5e4), (7.5e4, 3e4), (5e4, 2.5e4)]])
topo_list = [island1, island2]

# We can then pass these to `initialize_topography_field` with the `polys` keyword. We could
# also have defined them just by their coordinates and passed in the coordiantes by the `coords`
# keyword. 
topo_field = initialize_topography_field(; polys = topo_list)

# We can now plot the topography within the domain. 
topo_color = RGBf(115/255, 93/255, 55/255)  # brown color for topography
poly!(topo_field.poly; color = topo_color) # plot the topography
ax1.title = "Grid and Domain Setup"
fig  # display the figure


# ## Creating a Domian
# We now have all of the pieces needed to create a [`Domain`](@ref). We will combine the four
# (4) boundaries we created, and the topography, into one `Domain` object. The collection of
# boundaries and topography define where the floes can and cannot go in the simulation and add
# in boundary behavior.We can do that as follows:

domain = Domain(; north = north_bound, south = south_bound, east = east_bound, west = west_bound, topography = topo_field)

# !!! note
#       We could have skipped adding the topography to the domain. That is an optional
#       keyword and an empty `topography` field will be automatically created if the user does not
#       provide one.

# At this point, we have already plotted all of the `Domain` objects, so we will move in to adding
# environmental forcing from the ocean and the atmosphere.

# ## Creating an Ocean
# We can provide a ocean velocity and temperature fields to drive the floes within the simulatation.
# By default, this is a static vector field and does not change throughout the simulation. However,
# if you are interested in updating the code to make it easier to update the ocean/atmosphere fields
# throughout the simulation please see issue [#111](@ref).

# You can either provide a single constant value for each of the fields (and then also provide the `grid`
# as input) or provide a user-defined field. If providing a user-defined field, the field should be of
# size `(grid.Nx + 1, grid.Ny + 1)`. The rows represent velocities at the `x`-values of the grid
# (from `x0` to `xf`), while the columns represent velocities at the the `y`-values of the grid
# (from `y0` to `yf`). This makes it easy to index into the grid for values at point `(x, y)`.
# If `x` is the `i`th x-value between `x0` to `xf` and `y` is the `j`the `j`th y-value between
# `y0` to `yf` then you simply retrive the field values at index `[i, j]`. This does
# mean that the fields provided don't "look" like the grid when output directly in the terminal
# and would need to be transposed instead. 

# Here we will then define a `u`-velocity field that will impose a shear flow on the floes so
# that ocean is flowing faster in the middle of the y-values (at 0.25 m/s) and then
# symetrically slowing to 0m/s at the edges where the `CollisionBoundary` elements are. We will
# then provide a constant `temp`erature of -1 C and a constant `v`-velocity of 0m/s. 

function shear_flow_velocities(Nx, Ny, min_u, max_u)
    u_vals = fill(min_u, Nx, Ny)  # fill in field with min value
    increasing = true  # velocity values start by going up
    Δu = (max_u - min_u) / fld(Ny, 2)  # must reach max_u in the middle of the field
    curr_u = min_u + Δu  # first column already set to min_u
    for (i, col) in enumerate(eachcol(u_vals))
        (i == 1 || i == Ny) && continue  # edges already set to 0m/s
        col .= curr_u
        if increasing && curr_u == max_u  # reach max value and start decreasing velocity
            increasing = false
        end
        if increasing  # update velocity for next column
            curr_u += Δu
        else
            curr_u -= Δu
        end
    end
    return u_vals
end

u_vals = shear_flow_velocities(grid.Nx + 1, grid.Ny + 1, 0.0, 0.35)
ocean = Ocean(; u = u_vals, v = 0.0, temp = -1.0, grid)

# We can now plot our ocean velocity values on an axis below our `grid` and `domain` setup.
ax2 = Axis(fig[2, 1]; title = "Ocean U-Velocities [m/s]", xticklabelrotation = pi/4)
xs = grid.x0:grid.Δx:grid.xf
ys = grid.y0:grid.Δy:grid.yf
u_hm = heatmap!(ax2, xs, ys, ocean.u)
Colorbar(fig[2, end+1], u_hm)
resize_to_layout!(fig)
fig

# !!! note
#       The [`heatmap`](https://docs.makie.org/v0.21/reference/plots/heatmap)
#       already transposes the matrix input, assuming, as we do, that you index into the
#       matrix with x-values for rows and y-values for columns. If you want to see your
#       input as it would look on the grid, rather than manually transposing, just use the
#       `heatmap` function.

# Since the other ocean fields are constant values for each index, we won't plot these. 

# ## Creating an Atmosphere
# The atmosphere works almost iddntically to the `Ocean`. It also requires inputs for
# `u`-velocities, `v`-velocities, and `temp`erature and these fields are considered static 
# throughtout the simulation by default. Again, if you are interested in changing this, please
# see issue [#111](@ref).

# Just like with the `Ocean` constructor, you can either provide the `Atmos` constructor a 
# single constant value for each of the fields (and then also provide the grid as input) or
# provide a user-defined field. 

# Here, we will just provide constant values of 5m/s for the `u`-velocities, 0.0m/s for the
# `v`-velocities and 0 C for the `temp`erature. If you are intersted in providing non-constant
# fields, see the `Ocean` example above.

atmos = Atmos(; grid, u = 5.0, v = 0.0, temp = -2.0)

# Again since all of the fields are constant, we won't plot them, but you can, using the `heatmap`
# function as shown above. 

# ## Creating the Floes

# Within the simulation, there is a floe field, which is a list of [`Floe`](@ref) structs. For more information on these structs, see [`Floe`](@ref) documentation.
# However, it is **not** recommended for users to create individual floes. Rather, users should use the `initialize_floe_field` function to create a field of floes
# to start the simulation. Individual floes should only be created by developers when adding new simulation functionality.

# ### Creating a `AbstractFloeFieldGenerator`
# To use [`initialize_floe_field`](@ref), you first need to create a concrete subtype of [`AbstractFloeFieldGenerator`](@ref). Right now, there are two implemented.
# The first is the [`CoordinateListFieldGenerator`](@ref). This generator takes in a list of floe coordinates (along with other arguments) to create a list of floes.
# The second is the [`VoronoiTesselationFieldGenerator`](@ref). This generator tesselates the domain with floes and then randomly keeps various floes to match the
# user-provided floe concentration. 

# Here we will use the `VoronoiTesselationFieldGenerator` to generate a floe field. This generator object requires an input of the number of floes to be created (`nfloes`),
# a vector/matrix of concentrations to split the field into (`concentrations`), a mean height for the generated floe field (`hmean`), and a maximum range of heights (`Δh`) such that
# all floes have a height between `hmean - Δh` and `hmean + Δh`.

nfloes = 30
concentrations = [0.5 0.0]  # the left half of the domain is 85% packed and the right has no floes
hmean, Δh = 1.0, 0.25
generator = VoronoiTesselationFieldGenerator(; nfloes, concentrations, hmean, Δh)

# ### Creating `FloeSettings`

# [`FloeSettings`](@ref) can be used to set things like the minimum allowed floe area, the maximum hieght, the density of ice, and the
# `subfloe_point_generator`, which determines how to couple between the ice and ocean/atmosphere. There are also other fields within the
# [`FloeSettings`](@ref)!! It is important to understand all of its fields.

# !!! note
#       For consistency, `FloeSettings` also must be passed into the [`Simulation`](@ref) struct. 

# Here we will just create a `FloeSettings` struct with just a few of the keyword options.

floe_settings = FloeSettings(;
  min_floe_area = 1e5,
  max_floe_height = 5,
  subfloe_point_generator = SubGridPointsGenerator(; grid, npoint_per_cell = 2),
)

# ### Calling `initialize_floe_field`

# This generator is then the first keyword argument to the [`initialize_floe_field`](@ref) function. The other required keyword
# is the simulation domain. After that, we have optional keywords, including but not limited to `supress_warnings`, `rng`, and `floe_settings`.
# `supress_warnings` is a boolean that can turn off checks to ensure that all floe's have at least the minimum set area (see [`FloeSettings`](@ref) below)
# and that all floe centroids are within the `domain`. `rng` is a random number generator, possibly seeded for reproducability, used to generate floe heights
# and other random choices, like which floes to keep/remove to meet the requested concentrations.

floes = initialize_floe_field(; generator, domain, floe_settings, rng = Xoshiro(2))

# We can add the floes to the domain above.

floe_color = RGBf(217/255, 226/255, 225/255)  # blue color for floes
poly!(ax1, floes.poly; color = floe_color) # plot the topography
ax1.title = "Grid, Domain, and Floe Setup"
fig  # display the figure

# ## Creating a Model

# A `Model` combines all of the above components into the `Struct` that defines the physical aspects
# of a Subzero simulation. There are a few constraints: the domain must fall within the grid, the ocean
# and atmosphere must share the same grid (which can always be updated when the infrastructure for different
# grids is in place), and all fields must share the same Float type (i.e. `Float64` or `Float32`). This Float
# type will then be the Float type of the model, so it cannot be directly specified like it can when creating 
# the `Model` fields.

# A model can be made as follows:

model = Model(; grid, domain, ocean, atmos, floes)

# ## Constants

# We can then set a group of [`Constants`](@ref), which are a set of important physical parameters, like the ocean coriolis frequency and
# the air density. All constants have a default value, so you only need to change the ones that specifically affect your simulation. All
# constants and default values are listed in the [`Constants`](@ref) documentation.

# Here, I will just use the default values:

consts = Constants()

# ## Settings

# In addition to the [`FloeSettings`](@ref) discussed above, there are also settings for all of the other physical processes that can happen
# during a Subzero run. Here, I will just use all default settings except for the `FractureSettings`, but each of the following settings have documentation
# detailing how to turn features on/off and tune their behavior.

# The list of existing settings is:
# - [`FloeSettings`](@ref)
# - [`CouplingSettings`](@ref)
# - [`CollisionSettings`](@ref)
# - [`FractureSettings`](@ref)
# - [`SimplificationSettings`](@ref)
# - [`RidgeRaftSettings`](@ref)
# - [`WeldSettings`](@ref)

fracture_settings = FractureSettings(
        fractures_on = true,
        criteria = HiblerYieldCurve(floes),
        Δt = 500,
        npieces = 3,
        deform_on = false,
)

# ## Output Writers

# You also need to create a set of output writers to record the data from your simulation. You can add four types of output writers, and as many of each
# type as you would like. The four types are as follows: [`InitialStateOutputWriter`](@ref), [`CheckpointOutputWriter`](@ref),[ `FloeOutputWriter`](@ref), and
# [`GridOutputWriter`](@ref). When any of these objects are created, the file that they will write to is also created automatically. You can read more about each
# of these types of output writers within the API guide. You must then combine all of your output writers into an [`OutputWriters`](@ref) struct. You can simply
# pass each output writer created as an argument to the `OutputWriters` constructor. 

# Here, we will create an [`InitialStateOutputWriter`](@ref), a [`CheckpointOutputWriter`](@ref) (that outputs every 1000 timesteos), and a
# [ `FloeOutputWriter`](@ref) (that outputs every 100 timesteps) and then combine them into a [`OutputWriter`](@ref).

dir = "tutorial"
init_fn, checkpoint_fn, floe_fn = "tutorial_init_state.jld2", "tutorial_checkpoint.jld2", "tutorial_floes.jld2"

# We first make the [`InitialStateOutputWriter`](@ref):
initwriter = InitialStateOutputWriter(; dir = dir, filename = init_fn, overwrite = true)

# We then make the [`CheckpointOutputWriter`](@ref):
checkpointer = CheckpointOutputWriter(1000; dir = dir, filename = checkpoint_fn, overwrite = true)

# Finally, we make a [`FloeOutputWriter`](@ref):
floewriter = FloeOutputWriter(100; dir = dir, filename = floe_fn, overwrite = true)

# We can then combine these into an `OutputWriters` object:
writers = OutputWriters(initwriter, checkpointer, floewriter)

# ## Create a Simulation

# At this point, you are ready to make a `Simulation`. A `Simulation` has quite a few fields, all of which are talked about above in more detail.
# Since there are so many fields, they are keyword defined, so you must provide a keyword when creating the struct. The only necessary arguments
# are the `model` (to specify the simulation physical setup) and `floe_settings` (to ensure they match the argument used when creatting the `floes`).
# See the [`Simulation`](@ref) documentation for a full list of keyword arguments and their default values.

# In this tutorial, we create a simulation using all of the structs we created above. We will also need to set the simulation timestep `Δt` and the
# total number of timesteps to run for `nΔt`.

sim = Simulation(;
    model = model,
    consts = consts,
    Δt = 10, # timestep of 5 seconds
    nΔt = 20000, # run for 20,000 timesteps
    floe_settings = floe_settings,
    fracture_settings = fracture_settings,
    writers = writers,
)

# !!! note
#       Subzero also has a custom logger, [`SubzeroLogger`](@ref), which logs all of the info and warning messages that Subzero throws over
#       the course of a simularion into a log file. It will only output each unique message `messages_per_tstep` times, which can be passed
#       to the `run!` function. You can also create your own `SubzeroLogger`. However, here, for simplicity of the tutorial, I will turn off
#       all logging at or below `Info`.
Logging.disable_logging(Logging.Info)

# ## Running the Simulation
# You can now use the [`run!`](@ref) function to run the simulation.

run!(sim)

# !!! note
#       If you wish to couple to Oceananigans, you will need to run each model timestep by timestep
#       and pass the needed fields back and forth. You can run a single timestep of the simulation
#       using the [`timestep_sim!`](@ref) function.

# If you run your simulation in multiple parts and need to re-start your simulation from files,
# the [`restart!`](@ref) function will be a good place to start. However, note that it is quite simple
# and users may need to write their own restart function if they want more complex behavior. 

# ## Plotting the Simulation

# If your simulation has both a [`FloeOutputWriter`](@ref) and an [`InitialStateOutputWriter`](@ref),
# you can use the built in plotting function to make an MP4 file with each frame as a timestep saved
# by the `FloeOutputWriter`. This plotting function `plot_sim` is quite simple and just meant to get you started.
# You may need to add more complex plotting code to suit your needs.

plot_sim(joinpath(dir, floe_fn), joinpath(dir, init_fn), sim.Δt, joinpath(dir, "tutorial.mp4"))

# ```@raw html
# <video width="auto" controls autoplay loop>
# <source src="../tutorial/tutorial.mp4" type="video/mp4">
# </video>
# ```

# ## Reproducibility

# The simulations are currently completly reproducible when run single-threaded. The simulation takes a `rng` argument, and if it is provided with a seeded random number generator,
# then two simulations with the same set of starting floes will produce the exact same results. Note that the same set of floes can be reproduced by providing a seeded random number
# generator to the floe creation functions. Simulation reproducability has not been achieved for multi-threaded runs.
