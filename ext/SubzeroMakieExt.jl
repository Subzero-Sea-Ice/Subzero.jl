"""
    plot_sim(floe_fn, initial_state_fn, Δt, output_fn; max_side_pixels = 800)

Basic plotting of a simulation using the simulation's floe and initial state files. This
function is meant for basic plotting during testing and as an example of how to create
a video using Makie. The user can (and should!) write their own plotting code to their own
specifications and needs.

This code does not have an underlying ocean, but there are comments on how to add an ocean
heatmap and colorbar.

## Arguments:
- `floe_fn::String`: $(Subzero.FLOE_FN_DEF)
- `initial_state_fn::String`: $(Subzero.INITIAL_STATE_FN_DEF)
- $(Subzero.ΔT_DEF)
- `output_fn::String`: $(Subzero.MP4_OUTPUT_FN)

    it to the time observable! To learn more about Observables and how to use them with
