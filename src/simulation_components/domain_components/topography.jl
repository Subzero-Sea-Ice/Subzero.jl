    TopographyElement{FT}<:AbstractDomainElement{FT}

A concrete subtype of [`AbstractDomainElement`](@ref) that represent topography in a given
simulation. These `TopographyElement` objects will be treated as be treated as islands or
coastline within the model in that they will not move or break due to floe interactions, but
they will affect floes that collide with them. 

Similar to [`Floe`](@ref) objects, we store the shape of each `TopographyElement` with a
`poly` field. We also store the `centroid` and the shape's maximum radius (`rmax`) in order
to calculate simple interaction checks with Floes.

## _Fields_
- $POLY_DEF
- $CENTROID_DEF
- $RMAX_DEF

Here is how to construct an `TopographyElement`:

    TopographyElement([FT = Float64]; poly::Polys)

The user must provide a `GeoInterface` polygon of the specific type defined by `Polys`.
The user also has an opportunity to specify which float type `Float64` or `Float32` will be
used for field data.

## _Positional arguments_
- $FT_DEF

## _Keyword arguments_
- $POLY_DEF

## _Note_: The user should **NOT** be using this constructor. The user should create a topography
field using [`initialize_topography_field`](@ref) rather than creating individual topography
elements. This allows the abstraction of the use of the `StructArrays` package away from the
user.

## _Examples_
```jldoctest topography
julia> import GeoInterface as GI;

julia> poly = GI.Polygon([[(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1e3), (1e3, 1e3), (1e3, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0)]]);

julia> TopographyElement(Float64; poly)
TopographyElement{Float64}
  ⊢centroid is (500.0, 500.0) in meters
  ∟maximum radius is 707.10678 meters
```

```jldoctest topography
julia> TopographyElement(Float32; poly)
TopographyElement{Float32}
  ⊢centroid is (500.0, 500.0) in meters
  ∟maximum radius is 707.1068 meters
```

"""
    initialize_topography_field([::Type{FT} = Float64]; polys = nothing, coords = nothing)

This function allows for easy initialization of a field of [`TopographyElement(@ref)s and
collects them into a `StructArray` so that they can be passed into a [`Model`](@ref).

This is the suggested way to create a topography field for a simulation. Do NOT construct
individual `TopographyElement` objects as that method does not correct the field as a whole
to ensure no topography polygons overlap and does not create a struct array that can be
passed to a `Model`.

The user can create a topography field by either passing a list of polygons or by passing
a list of coordiantes, which will then be made into polygons.

## _Positional arguments_
- $FT_DEF

## _Keyword arguments_
- $POLY_LIST_DEF
- $COORDS_LIST_DEF

!!! note
    Topography field elements must not be intersecting, so the corrections within this
    function may lead to a different number of polygons than input to make a valid
    topography field.

## _Examples_
- Defining a topography field with coordinates
```jldoctest topo_field
julia> coords = [[[(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0)]], [[(10.0, 0.0), (10.0, 1.0), (11.0, 1.0), (10.0, 0.0)]]];

 TopographyElement{Float64}
  ⊢centroid is (0.33333, 0.66667) in meters
  ∟maximum radius is 0.74536 meters
 TopographyElement{Float64}
  ⊢centroid is (10.33333, 0.66667) in meters
  ∟maximum radius is 0.74536 meters
```

- Defining a topography field with polygons
```jldoctest topo_field
julia> import GeoInterface as GI;

julia> polys = [GI.Polygon(c) for c in coords];

julia> initialize_topography_field(Float32; polys)
2-element TopographyField{Float32} list:

 TopographyElement{Float32}
  ⊢centroid is (10.33333, 0.66667) in meters
  ∟maximum radius is 0.74536 meters
```

- Creating an empty topography field without polys or coords
```jldoctest
julia> initialize_topography_field(Float64)
TopographyElement{Float64}[]
```
