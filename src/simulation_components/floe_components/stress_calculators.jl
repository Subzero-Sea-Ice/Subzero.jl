## What is a stress calculator? 

A stress calculator defines how the stress for a floe is calculated from its interactions
and how that stress is used to determine fracture. 

The `AbstractStressCalculator` is the abstract type, with `DecayAreaScaledCalculator`
currently implemented and the infrastructure for `DamageStressCalculator` setup for future
implementation.

Each of these concrete types represent different methods of calculating a floe's stress. A
`FloeSettings` struct requires a concrete subtype of `AbstractStressCalculator`. The
functions for calculating stress are then dispatched off of this calculator type. Those
functions currently are: `_update_stress_accum!` and `_scale_principal_stress!`. These
functions need to be extended for any new concrete subtype of `AbstractStressCalculator`.

"""
    abstract type AbstractStressCalculator{FT <: AbstractFloat}

Abstract super type for stress calculators, which calculate a floe's stress from floe
interactions. The subtypes serve as dispatch types for the following three calculation
methods.

## API
The following methods must be implemented for all subtypes:
- `_update_stress_accum!(stress_calculator::AbstractStressCalculator{FT}, curr_stress::Matrix{FT} , floe::FloeType{FT})`
- `_update_stress_accum!(stress_calculator::AbstractStressCalculator{FT}, floes::FixedWidthFloes{FT}, i)`
- `_scale_principal_stress!(stress_calculator::AbstractStressCalculator{FT}, σvals::Matrix{FT}, floe::FloeType{FT}, floe_settings::FloeSettings)`

`_update_stress_accum!` is called in the `calc_stress!` function and takes the stress
calculator, the `floe`'s instantatious stress at the current timestep, and the `floe` itself
and updates the `floe`'s `stress_accum` field, which is used when determining floe fracture
based off of stress. Within the function, other floe fields can be updated as needed.
The method for `FixedWidthFloes` does the same for floe `i`, reading the instantaneous stress
from `floes.stress_instant`. It is called from a GPU kernel, so it must use scalar operations
and must not allocate.

`_scale_principal_stress!` is called within the `find_σpoint` function which is called
within the `determine_fractures` function. This function takes the stress calculator, the
`floe`'s accumulated stress in prinicpal stress space (`σvals = eigvals(stress_accum)`), the
`floe` itself, and the `floe_settings` and scales `σvals` by some values/ratio using
physical properties within `floe` and `floe_settings`. This is done to approximate changing
the polygon defining the floe's fracture criteria without having to redefine the fracture 
criteria for each floe. This is almost like a proxy for damage.

space is inside or outside of the fracture criteria polygon. Any calculators that do NOT
want to scale stress in this way can simply skip implementing this function and fall back
on this default. =#

"""
    DecayAreaScaledCalculator{FT<:AbstractFloat} <: AbstractStressCalculator{FT}

Type of [`AbstractStressCalculator`](@ref) that implements stress calculations by accumulating each
timestep of stress using a decay equation. The decay aspect increases importance placed on
new damage. The decay equation is as follows:

`stress_accum = stress_accum(1-λ) + stress_instant(λ)

The area-scaling part of the stress calculations comes into play when deciding if a floe
will be fractured. The accumulated stress can be scaled by a ratio of
(floe.area/min_floe_area)^α. By changing the α value, either larger or smaller floes
fracture more eassily. The scaled value will not be saved as this is equivalent to scaling
the simulation fracture criteria (morh's cone or hibler's ellipse, etc.), but it is less
computationally intensive. By leaving the default `α = 0`, this extra scaling will not
take place.

## Fields:
- `λ::AbstractFloat`: decay parameter used when calculating accumulated stress. Should be between 0 - 1.
- `α::AbstractFloat`: Adjusts ellipse in stress space by raising the ratio to the floe's area over the simulation minimum floe size to `α`.
## Note:
- `λ` is used in `_update_stress_accum!`, whereas α is used in `_scale_principal_stress!`.

    DamageStressCalculator{FT<:AbstractFloat} <: AbstractStressCalculator{FT}

Type of AbstractStressCalculator that calculates stress with each timestep with
`damage * stress_instant`, as suggested by Mukund Gupta. This method could keep track of
damage directly within each floe using the `damage` floe field, perhapes as a value between
0-1, and rather than calculating an "accumulated stress" to store damage, as done in
`DecayAreaScaledCalculator`.

In this calculator, the floe's `damage` field keeps track of an explicit parameter.

This method is not implemented and thus throws an error upon creation. The infrastructure
for the damage calculator is provided, but functions that depend on this calculator need to
be implemented as detailed in the `AbstractStressCalculator` API.
